      <p> I am a rising junior at NYU and am studying Computer Science and Economics. My passions are sports, gaming, and working out (especially biking since all the gyms near me are closed). </p>
      <p> Here are my favorite soccer teams: </p>
      <img src = "/images/1200px-FC_Barcelona_(crest).svg.png">
      <p> I grew up watching FC Barcelona and Lionel Messi is one of my biggest role models.</p>

      <p> The first ever Manchester City game I watched was their iconic game vs Queens Park Rangers. </p>
      <p> I look forward to working with my team on future projects and am exited to tackle this summer's program!</p>
